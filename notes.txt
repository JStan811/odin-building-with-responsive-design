Project Plan
  - Create each component (the header, each div, then the footer) at my viewport size - >1024px
    - ONE AT A TIME :) Rome wasn't built in a day
  - Make changes for second viewport, >767px
  - Make changes for third viewport, <=767px


To-do
  - update element types and class names. Try to use semantic html. Maybe check the source code to see how to do it
  - where is the top yellow section getting that shadow/gradient from?
  - make GET TICKETS button in featured articles grid clickable
  - add actual links from the site
