Notes
  - breakpoints: 1024px width, 767px width
    - modifications needed at each width:
      - 1024px:
        - header/navbar
        - yellow conference cta
        - main logo / heading
        - featured article grid
        - popular articles today
        - latest stories
        - work with us company list
        - footer
      - 767px:
        - featured article grid
        - popular articles today
        - latest stories
        - watch what we made for you
        - work with us

Project Plan
  - Create each component (the header, each div, then the footer) at my viewport size - >1024px
    - ONE AT A TIME :) Rome wasn't built in a day
  - Make changes for second viewport, >767px
  - Make changes for third viewport, <=767px


To-do
  - update element types and class names. Try to use semantic html. Maybe check the source code to see how to do it
  - where is the top yellow section getting that shadow/gradient from?
  - make GET TICKETS button in featured articles grid clickable
  - add actual links from the site
  - add zoom hover effect on featured articles
  - add animation on Latest Stories ALL NEWS button
  - fill in img alt texts
  - update fonts
  - add scrollbar to "Watch our vids" section. (I think I'd have to change the whole section from a grid into something and a sidebar)
  - change how tabbing works (on my page a black outline appears over item)
  - the hover effect on their work with us section companies navbar is gradual, whereas mine is istantaneous (may also be true for newsletter cta social navbar)
  - change color of TNW logo
  - why is the embedded video the wrong height on Mac/Safari
    - also test Safari further (and other browsers?)
  - change page title to match source and have the title change based on whether the tab is active or not
  - add inlaid scrollbar for video section at max resolution
  - at smallest breakpoints, add horizontal scrollbars (touch-only, ie they don't show on the screen) for featured articles and video sections
