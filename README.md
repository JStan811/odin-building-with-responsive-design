# odin-building-with-responsive-design

This Building with Responsive Design project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design) aims to clone [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/), "a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced." The focus here is on building a responsive webpage.
